To work on the project you just need these packages installed on your computer:

	python 2.7+
	python-virtualenv
	python-pip

if all those are installed just 'cd' to the project folder and execute:

	mkdir env
	virtualenv env
	source env/bin/activate
	./setup_env.sh


virtualenv will create a python enviroment for this project
./setup_env will download all dependencies and install them locally (no need for root privileges) just for the project

to create the database:
	./manage.py syncdb
to test the webapp and then browse to http://localhost:8000
	./manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000
