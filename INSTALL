### Introduction

Agora Ciudadana is a social web site where anyone can create or join in an agora.
An agora has a set of members which can vote in the agora's elections either by
direct vote or by delegating the vote.

You can see a  live version of Agora here: http://agoraciudadana.org
The source code is available here: http://github.com/agoraciudadana/agora-ciudadana

### Dependencies

* Python 2.x >= 2.7
* python-virtualenv
* Has only been tested in Linux so far

Other dependencies can be installed with virtualenv.


### First installation

Here we will detail the most simple way to get the application running. For a
more detailed explanation about how to deploy a django, refer to:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/

First thing we need is installing the dependencies in virtualenv:

    $ ./setup_env.sh

Now everytime we want to use the installed virtualenv, we can do the
following within the directory containing the env/ subdirectory:

    $ source env/bin/activate

After that, we need to configure the database (we use sqlite by default):

    $ ./manage.py syncdb --migrate

Then create the admin user in the database: # TODO, initial-data.json not
available yet

    $ ./manage.py loaddata initial-data.json


That's it! Start the webserver with:

    $ ./manage.py runserver

Now you'll be able to enter to Agora in http://localhost:8000

Of course this is a very simple and local installation. We recomend using a
web server like cherokee, lighthttpd or apache configured to use fast-cgi and
django, and a more powerful database like postgresql. Django documentation
explains how to do that:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/

### Send email updates

If you want users to receive email reminders about unread messages or pending
transfers, you should add a cron task that visits every day the following url:
http://<yourserver>/tasks/send_email_updates/ .

This can be done adding a timebank.sh script to /etc/cron.daily/ with execution
permissions as the following:

    #!/bin/bash
    wget http://<tuservidor>/tasks/send_email_updates/ -O /dev/null

### Translations

Timebank has internationalization support and is translated to multiple
languages. In order to make these translations available in your installation,
you need to compile the translation (.po) files:

    $ ./manage.py compilemessages

### Settings configuration

The settings.py file contains the default configuration for the project. You
shouldn't modify it; any settings configuration you need should be added to the
local_settings.py file.

Most of the variables in settings are self-explanatory and are documented in
django: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/

There are some settings non standard in django in the settings.py file,
quite self explanatory, but you can ask us if you need help with them. See
Contact seccion for that.
